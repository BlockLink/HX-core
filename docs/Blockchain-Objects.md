In contrast to most cryptocurrency wallets, the BitShares 2.0 has a different
model to represent the blockchain, its transactions and accounts. This chapter
wants to given an introduction to the concepts of *objects* as they are used by
the BitShares 2.0 client. Furthermore, we will briefly introduce the API and
show how to subscribe to object changes (such as new blocks or incoming
deposits). Afterwards, we will show how exchange may monitor their accounts and
credit incoming funds to their corresponding users.

Objects
-------
On the BitShares blockchains there are no addresses, but objects identified by a
unique *id*, an *type* and a *space* in the form:

    space.type.id

Some examples:

    1.2.15   # protocol space / account / id: 15
    1.6.105  # protocol space / witness / id: 105
    1.14.7   # protocol space / worker / id: 7

    2.1.0    # implementation space / dynamic global properties
    2.3.8    # implementation space / asset . id: 8

A programmatic description of all fields can be found in the
[sources](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/master/libraries/chain/include/graphene/chain/protocol/types.hpp).

Accounts
--------
The BitShares blockchain users are requires to register each account with a
unique username and a public key on the blockchain. The blockchain assigns an
incremental user *id* and offers to resolve the name-to-id pair. For instance
`1.2.15`

    2.6.80    # implementation space / account-balance / id: 80
    2.7.80    # implementation space / account-statistics / id: 80
    2.10.80   # implementation space / account-transactions / id: 80
    2.8.80    # implementation space / transactions / id: 80
    2.9.80    # implementation space / block-summary / id: 80
